# word-cloud-project-Vehicle-Crash-
For this data analysis project, I created a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script.  This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.

Following are the screenshots of the main python function for file handling and a illustration of the final view of the word cloud, feel free to check the notebook in repository for more datails
